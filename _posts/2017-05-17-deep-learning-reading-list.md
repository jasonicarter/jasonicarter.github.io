## Backstory
If you're here without context, let me bring you up to speed. About one months ago, I left my job to take time off and
pursue a learning path into the emerging field of Deep Learning. To that end, I put together a self-study plan which you can read 
more about on [Medium](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/my-3-month-deep-learning-career-pivot-af94cd8d6a31) 
and an updated/revised version on [LinkedIn]().

My study plan covered a few items but it was mainly the [Fast.ai MOOC](http://course.fast.ai) and the benchmark project 
which contributes to my daily reading and watching material. That material is listed below and will be updated 
as I continue my progress into the field of deep learning.

If you're starting your journey and looking for examples of a study path and material to use, hopefully this will help.

and attempting to understand.

Disclaimer: I do not understand everything I read :)
