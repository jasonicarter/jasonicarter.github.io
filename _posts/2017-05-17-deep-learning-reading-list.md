## Backstory
*(Last Updated: June, 2017)* If you're here without context, let me bring you up to speed. Early 2017 I quit my job in order to study full time to pursue a learning path into the emerging field of Deep Learning. To that end, I put together a self-study plan which you can read 
more about on [Medium](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/my-3-month-deep-learning-career-pivot-af94cd8d6a31) 
and an updated/revised version on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/self-study-guide-becoming-deep-learning-non-expert-jason-carter).

My study plan covered a few large "pieces" of study material, mainly the [Fast.ai MOOC](http://course.fast.ai) and a benchmark project. However, since starting, I've expanded my studies for a number of reasons which I'll leave for another blog article. The material I've covered so far is listed below and will be updated as I continue my progress into the field of deep learning.

If you're starting your journey and looking for examples of a study path and material to use, hopefully this will help.
